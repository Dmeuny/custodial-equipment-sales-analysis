# custodial-equipment-sales-analysis
Portfolio project: sales performance analysis by state, channel, and product subcategory (38k+ records).



Goal: Analyze US custodial equipment sales by state, channel, and product category. Compare actual revenue to targets, identify top/bottom performers, and highlight key trends for management decision-making.




üìÇ Dataset

Rows: ~38,880

Columns: 19

Coverage: All 50 US states + DC, multiple cities

Metrics:

Sales: Units_Sold, Unit_Price, Revenue, Profit, Margin_Percent

Targets: Target_Units, Target_Revenue

Geography: State, City, Latitude, Longitude

Time: Date, Month

Channels: Sales_Channel (Direct, Distributor, Online)

Product taxonomy: Product_Category, Product_Subcategory



‚ùì Business Questions Answered

Which states generated the most revenue, and how did they perform vs target?

How do sales channels compare in units sold, revenue, profit, and margin %?

Which product subcategories drive the most profit (and highest margins)?

What does the monthly revenue trend look like, and how is growth changing month-over-month?

Which cities are top and bottom performers by profit?



üîë Key Findings

Geography: California and Texas lead in total revenue, but several Midwest states missed their revenue targets (<95% attainment).

Channels: Direct Sales delivers the most revenue, while Distributor margins are significantly lower ‚Äî suggesting discounting.

Products: Walk-Behind Scrubbers dominate profit contribution, while smaller categories show higher % margins.

Trends: Revenue peaked in Q3 but slowed into Q4 ‚Äî Q1 pipeline building will be critical.

Cities: Dallas and New York are strong profit centers, while smaller cities underperform consistently.
